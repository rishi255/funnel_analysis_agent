# funnel_analysis_agent

## TODO

    - [x] Have a basic working NLP to SQL agent that understands Funnel analysis and is able to generate + execute SQL queries by auto-fetching metadata about tables, columns etc.
    - [] Fine-tune the model on Pinot's documentation before usage:
        - [] Ideally use langchain tools for RAG after scraping the website
